# Professional Portfolio Website - Individual Project 1

This is a professional portfolio website created as a requirement for the Web Application Programming and Hacking (WAPH) course at the University of Dayton, instructed by Dr. Phu Phung.

**Live Site URL:** https://pranay2503.github.io/

## Project Description

This project is a fully responsive, single-page professional portfolio designed to showcase my skills, projects, and background to potential employers. The site is built using modern front-end technologies and integrates several dynamic features and third-party APIs to create an interactive user experience. It also includes a dedicated page that provides an overview of the WAPH course and its objectives.

## Features Implemented

The website includes a wide range of features that demonstrate proficiency in front-end development and API integration:

### Main Layout & Design

- **Responsive Design:** Built with the Bootstrap framework to ensure a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Professional Sections:** Includes dedicated sections for an "About Me" summary, a "Skills" overview with progress bars, a "Portfolio" to showcase projects, and a "Contact" section with social media links.
- **WAPH Course Page:** A separate HTML page providing details about the Web Application Programming and Hacking course.

### Dynamic JavaScript Features

- **Animated Hero Text:** Uses the Typed.js library to create an animated typing effect in the hero section.
- **Live Clocks:** Displays both a real-time digital clock and a functioning analog clock, built with JavaScript and the HTML Canvas API.
- **Interactive Email:** A "Show/Hide" button to toggle the visibility of my email address.
- **Cookie-Based Greeting:** Remembers visitors using JavaScript cookies. A first-time visitor receives a standard welcome, while a returning visitor is greeted with a "Welcome back!" message that includes the timestamp of their last visit.
- **Page Tracker:** Includes a Flag Counter to track visitors to the site.

### API Integrations

- **Joke of the Minute:** Fetches a new programming or pun joke every 60 seconds from the JokeAPI and displays it on the page.
- **Random XKCD Comic:** Fetches and displays a random webcomic from the XKCD API. This implementation uses a CORS proxy to handle cross-origin requests, demonstrating a practical solution to a common web development challenge.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the core structure and content of the website.
- **CSS3:** For custom styling, animations, and layout enhancements.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all dynamic functionality, DOM manipulation, and API interactions.
- **Bootstrap 5:** As the primary CSS framework for responsive design and UI components.
- **jQuery:** Used for simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **Typed.js:** For the hero section text animation.
- **Public APIs:** JokeAPI and XKCD API.
